                Social Network Analysis and Mining research have experienced an exponential growth in recent years, their application to industry and society has attracted the interest of scientists and engineers from a wide variety of areas such as Data Science, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, Physics, Sociology or Psychology, just to mention a few of them. One of the reasons of this increasing interest is due to this application domain offers a particularly fertile place to test and develop the most advanced techniques, which can be used to extract some valuable information from these Online Social Networks. Current open problems, as Community Detection on networks (static and dynamic), Analysis of Information Diffusion, Sentiment Analysis and Opinion mining, or Visualization, etc. are proposing new techniques to handle with the huge complexity of the information available. To tackle with this complexity, evolutionary algorithms (as those based on multi or many objectives, differential evolution, or evolutionary strategies), and Swarm algorithms (as Ant Colonies, Particle swarms, Artificial Bees or Bat algorithms, among many others), have been successfully applied to face the SNA problems. This workshop aims to be a cross-disciplinary place to bring together experts, researchers and practitioners from several communities including computer science, physics, mathematics, marketing, sociology, psychology, etc., to explore the use of Evolutionary and Bio-inspired models, techniques and algorithms to work with the data, knowledge, and patterns, usually not trivial or hidden, stored at Social Networks.
